## The Fake Buyer Identification System is designed to detect suspicious or fraudulent transactions from a given dataset (Yoshops.com Sale Order file).
## The system conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) based on several conditions that are commonly associated with fraudulent activities.
## It then generates both CSV files for further analysis and a PDF report summarizing the key findings.

This project automates the detection process by analyzing patterns and behaviors that might indicate fraudulent activity, 
such as discrepancies in shipping and billing addresses, unusually large orders, and multiple orders using different payment methods.

Features
Shipping address differs from the billing address:
- Identifies orders where the shipping and billing addresses do not match.
- Output: Shipping_Differs_from_Billing.csv.
Multiple orders of the same item:
- Detects repeated purchases of the same item within the same order.
- Output: Multiple_Orders_of_Same_Item.csv.
Unusually large orders:
- Finds orders where the quantity exceeds a set threshold (top 5%).
-Output: Unusually_Large_Orders.csv.
Multiple orders to the same address with different payment methods:
- Identifies cases where multiple orders are shipped to the same address but use different payment methods.
- Output: Multiple_Payment_Methods_at_Same_Address.csv.
Unexpected international orders:
- Flags orders where the shipping address is outside the expected country (India).
- Output: Unexpected_International_Orders.csv.
PDF Report:
- Summarizes all the findings from the EDA in a single PDF report.
- Output: Fake_Buyer_Identification_EDA_Report.pdf.
  
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Yoshops.com Sale Order file containing order details 
such as billing and shipping addresses, order quantities, payment methods, and more.

Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly and placed in the appropriate directory.
Columns Required:
- Billing Street Address
- Shipping Street Address
- LineItem Qty
- Total
- Payment Method
- Shipping Country
- Order

Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pandas: For data processing.
- FPDF: For generating the PDF report.
- Matplotlib / Seaborn: (Optional, if any graphs are needed).

How It Works
1. The script loads the dataset and preprocesses relevant columns (e.g., filling missing values, converting data types).
2. For each condition (e.g., mismatched addresses, unusually large orders), it filters the dataset and exports the results to CSV files.
3. A PDF report summarizing the results of the analysis is generated, containing a list of all identified suspicious patterns.
4. The CSV files and the PDF report can be used for further investigation or visualization.
Output

The following files will be generated after running the script:
1. Shipping_Differs_from_Billing.csv: Contains orders where shipping and billing addresses do not match.
2. Multiple_Orders_of_Same_Item.csv: Contains orders with multiple instances of the same item.
3. Unusually_Large_Orders.csv: Contains orders that exceed the top 5% in quantity.
4. Multiple_Payment_Methods_at_Same_Address.csv: Contains addresses with multiple orders using different payment methods.
5. Unexpected_International_Orders.csv: Contains orders where the shipping address is outside of India.
6. Fake_Buyer_Identification_EDA_Report.pdf: A PDF summary report of all the findings.
   
Example
Here's a sample output for "Shipping address differs from billing address":
Order # | Billing Address           | Shipping Address
--------------------------------------------------------
1001    | 123 Main St, Delhi         | 789 Elm St, Mumbai
1005    | 456 Oak St, Chennai        | 456 Oak St, Unknown

Conclusion
This project provides a systematic way to detect potentially fraudulent transactions by analyzing specific data patterns. 
The output CSV files and PDF reports can assist in identifying high-risk transactions and improving the security of the sales order system.
